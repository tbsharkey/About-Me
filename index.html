            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated from the Marine Military Academy in 2003. It's the only Marine Corps based high school and is located in Harlingen, TX.</p>
            <p>I graduated from The Citadel in 2010. It's South Carolina's only remaining military college and is located in Charleston, SC. I was a Marine reservist while I was in school and had to leave on a number of occasions for active duty service. I started with a degree</p>
            <p>I started attending Western Governors University's Cloud Computing degree in 2022 as it was paid for by my employer. As I'm no longer with that
                employer I've put off the classes until I'm finished with Code Fellows but will continue with certifications which will give me class credit. I plan to finish no later than the end of 2024</p>
